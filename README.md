## App Title slateDriver

## What is the purpose of this app?
This is fills a very real need, of mine and of people I know and communicate with.

This app is designed to be an easy way for someone to:
- Share who they are going to vote for.
- Make recommendations to others.
ie "I am voting for candidate x, because y"

It should be a simpler and easier way for someone to be able to tell others what they are choosing and recommending in
a political cycle.
Easier that a word document, or simply trying to type it out on multiple pages of a word document.

Reach goals are to make this easily shareable via twitter, and maybe facebook.
